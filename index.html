          Super Smash Bros. Melee[a] is a 2001 crossover fighting video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo
          for the GameCube. It is the second installment in the Super Smash Bros. series. It features characters from Nintendo
          video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox and Pok√©mon, among others. The stages and gameplay
          modes reference or take designs from these franchises as well.
          <br><br>
          Melee includes all playable characters from the first game and also adds characters from additional franchises such as
          Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time, in addition to new stages and gameplay
          modes. Like other games in the Smash Bros. series, Melee's gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting
          game genre, with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, representing the knockback the character
          will experience, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games.
          
          <br><br>
          Melee was first released in Japan in November 2001, in the Americas in December 2001, and in Europe and Australia in May
          2002. The game received widespread acclaim from critics, earning praise for its visuals, simple controls, gameplay, and
          orchestrated soundtrack, as well as several awards and acknowledgments from various publications; it is now considered
          one of the greatest video games ever made. It achieved strong sales upon its release, becoming the GameCube's
          best-selling title with over seven million copies sold by 2008. Considered one of the most competitively viable Smash
          Bros. games due to its fast-paced and offensive gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming
          tournaments, boasting a dedicated grassroots fan community which has kept its competitive scene alive well beyond the
          game's original lifespan. It was followed by Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii in 2008.
